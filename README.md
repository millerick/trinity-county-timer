# Trinity County Timer

Created for use during meetings where a timer is required.
Deployed on Github pages.

[Timer](https://millerick.github.io/trinity-county-timer/)

## Different Timers

The timer defaults to three minutes because this is what is used in the majority of meetings.
A different duration can be used by setting the `minutes` query parameter.
As an example, [https://millerick.github.io/trinity-county-timer/?minutes=5](https://millerick.github.io/trinity-county-timer/?minutes=5) will create a 5 minute timer.
